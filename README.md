This workshop is also available as a [mdbook](https://pi-api-rouge.vercel.app/book/index.html)

## 1. Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to create a Python API service with FastAPI using Poetry, Rust bindings for Python and Docker.

Specifically, we will build a simple API service that will give the N-th digits of pi. The API service will be written in Python using FastAPI. The API service will use Rust bindings for Python to calculate the pi digits to make it blazingly fast. The API service will be packaged in a Docker container.

### 1.1. What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

### 1.2. What is Poetry?

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

### 1.3. What is Rust?

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.

### 1.4. What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## 2. Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2.1. Install Python 3.10+

A good way to install Python 3.10+ is to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Note: you may need to add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

To verify that pyenv is installed, run:

```bash
pyenv --version
```

### 2.2. Install Poetry

[Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

To verify that Poetry is installed, run:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### 2.3. Install Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Note: you may need to add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

To verify that Rust is installed, run:

```bash
rustc .-vV
```

### 2.4. Install Docker

### 2.6 Repository Structure

```txt
├── api            # Rust API code
│   ├── lib        # Actix-Web API code
│   └── shuttle    # Shuttle project
├── front          # Dioxus front-end code
├── shared         # Common code shared between the API and the front-end
└── README.md      # Workshop instructions and guidance
```

## 3. Project Setup

Now that we have all the prerequisites installed, we can start setting up our project. First we will create a new project with Poetry and then we will add FastAPI as a dependency. We will also add a few other dependencies that we will need later on. Finally, we will create a new Dockerfile to package our API service in a Docker container. We will also create a docker-compose.yml file to run our API service and a few other services in Docker containers.

### 3.1. Create a new project with Poetry

We will start by creating a new project with Poetry. We will call our project `pi-api`.

```bash
poetry new --src pi-api
```

This will create a new project called `pi-api` with the following structure:

```txt
├── pi-api
   ├── src
   │   └── pi_api
   │       └── __init__.py
   ├── tests
   │   ├── __init__.py
   ├── pyproject.toml
   └── README.md

```

You can read more about Poetry's new command [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#new).

Initiate a git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Finally add `.gitignore` file to the root of the project:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

### 3.2 Install Python using pyenv

We will use pyenv to install latest Python version 3.12
You check which versions are available with:

```bash
pyenv install --list #this will output all the versions available
```

```bash
pyenv install --list | grep 3.12
```

```bash
pyenv install 3.12.0
```

Once the installation is complete, you can set project specific Python version with:

```bash
pyenv local 3.12.0
```

This command creates a .python-version file in your current directory.

### 3.3 Create a new virtual environment

We will create a new virtual environment for our project with Poetry.
Poetry doesn’t create a virtual environment right away when you start a project. You can tell Poetry explicitly which Python version you want to use for it and go from there:

```bash
poetry env use 3.12.0
```

For me this will print out the following:

```bash
Creating virtualenv pi-api-MilAWA87-py3.12 in /home/mikko/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs
Using virtualenv: /home/mikko/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/pi-api-MilAWA87-py3.12
```

To verify that the virtual environment is created, run:

```bash
poetry env list
```

It should output something like this:

```bash
pi-api-MilAWA87-py3.12 (Activated)
```

### 3.4 Add Python dependencies

#### Poetry add

We will add the following dependencies to our project:

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
- [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/)

```bash
poetry add fastapi uvicorn maturin
```

When you run the poetry add command, Poetry automatically updates pyproject.toml (`tool.poetry.dependencies`) and pins the resolved versions in the poetry.lock file. You can read more about Poetry's add command [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add). More info about the dependency specification can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/).

If you like to add a development dependency, you can use the --dev flag:

```bash
poetry add --group dev mypy
```

This will add mypy as a development dependency to your project. Specifically, it will add mypy to the [tool.poetry.dev-dependencies] section in pyproject.toml.

#### Poetry lock

You can also manually add dependencies to the pyproject.toml file and lock them afterward. After manually adding a dependency to pyproject.toml, you can run the following command to update the lock file:

```bash
poetry lock
```

Note: `poetry lock` will also update the lock file if you have added dependencies with the `poetry add` command. f you don’t want to update any dependencies that are already in the poetry.lock file, then you have to add the --no-update option to the poetry lock command:

```bash
poetry lock --no-update
```

In this case, Poetry only resolves the new dependencies but leaves any existing dependency versions inside the poetry.lock file untouched.

While the version requirement in the pyproject.toml file can be loose, Poetry locks the versions you’re actually using in the `poetry.lock` file. That’s why you should commit this file if you’re using Git. By providing a `poetry.lock` file in a Git repository, you ensure that all developers will use identical versions of required packages. When you come across a repository that contains a poetry.lock file, it’s a good idea to use Poetry for it.

You can read more about Poetry's lock command [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#lock).  

#### Poetry install

You can install the dependencies from the lock file with the following command:

```bash

poetry install
```

By running `poetry install`, Poetry reads the poetry.lock file and installs all dependencies that are declared in it.

You can read more about Poetry's install command [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#install).

#### Poetry update

You can update the dependencies in the lock file with the following command:

```bash
poetry update
```

The `update` command will update all your packages and their dependencies within their version constraints. Afterward, Poetry will update your poetry.lock file. You can control which packages to update by specifying their names. For example, to update only the mypy package, you can run:

```bash
poetry update mypy
```

or to only update the packages in the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section, you can run:

```bash
poetry update --without dev-dependencies
```

You can read more about Poetry's update command [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#update).

#### About pyproject.toml

The pyproject.toml file is the heart of your project. It’s a configuration file standard that was defined in [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/). It contains all the metadata about your project, its dependencies, and build instructions. It is meant to replace the old setup.py and requirements.txt files.

You can read more about pyproject.toml [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/).
Python packaging user guide [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/).

### 3.5 Add Rust extension to the project

We will now add a Rust extension to our project. We will use [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/) to build the Rust extension. Maturin is a command-line tool to build and publish crates with pyo3, rust-cpython and cffi bindings as well as rust binaries as Python packages.

You can easily add a Rust extension to your project with the following command:

```bash
poetry run maturin new rust-pidigits
```

This will create a new Rust extension called `rust-pidigits` in the `rust-pidigits` directory. The `rust-pidigits` directory will contain the following files:

```txt
├── rust-pidigits
│   ├── Cargo.toml
|   ├── Cargo.lock
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs

```

We can also remove the `pyproject.toml` file because we will use the `pyproject.toml` file in the root of the project. Change `build-system` table in `pyproject.toml` to:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["maturin>=1.4,<2.0"]
build-backend = "maturin"
```

Add the following table to the `pyproject.toml` file to configure maturin:

```toml
[tool.maturin]
# The name of the crate
name = "rust-pidigits"
# The version of the crate
version = "0.1.0"
# The name of the Python module
module = "rust_pidigits"
# The path to the Rust source code
path = "pidigits-rust/src/lib.rs"
# The minimum Python version required to use the crate
requires-python = ">=3.11"
# The Rust features to build with
features = ["pyo3/extension-module"]
description = "Calculate pi to the Nth digit"
readme = "README.md"
license = { file = "LICENSE.txt" }
# Remove this if you don't have clang and lld installed
# You can install clang and lld with `sudo apt install clang lld`
rustc-args = [
    "-C",
    "linker=clang",
    "-C",
    "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld",
    "-C",
    "target-cpu=native",
]
manifest-path = "rust-pidigits/Cargo.toml"
profile = "release"
strip = true
codegen-units = 1
lto = true
```

You can read more about maturin's configuration [here](https://www.maturin.rs/config)

We can also add more Metadata to the `pyproject.toml` file: check out the specification from [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#pyproject-toml-spec)

For example, we can add the following Metadata to the `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
name = "pidigits"
keywords = ["pi", "pi to the nth digit"]
authors = [
    { email = "mikko.leppanen@vaisala.com" },
    { name = "Mikko Leppänen" },
]
maintainers = [
    { name = "Mikko Leppänen", email = "mikko.leppanen@vaisala.com" },
]
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python",
    "Programming Language :: Rust",
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: POSIX :: Linux",
    "Intended Audience :: Developers",
]
```

Then the final thing we need to do is to add a couple of Rust dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:

- [rug](https://crates.io/crates/rug)
- [pyo3](https://crates.io/crates/pyo3)

```bash
cargo add rug -F float,integer
cargo add pyo3
```

This will add the following dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file (your versions may differ):

```toml
[dependencies]
pyo3 = "0.20.2"
rug = { version = "1.22.0", features = ["float", "integer"] }
```

Now we are ready to start actually writing some Python&Rust code! 🎉

### 4. Application Development

We will start by writing the Python code for our API service. We will use FastAPI to create the API service. We will also use uvicorn to run the API service. We will then write the Rust code for our API service. We will use Rust bindings for Python to calculate the pi digits. Finally, we will write a Dockerfile to package our API service in a Docker container. We will also write a docker-compose.yml file to run our API service and a few other services in Docker containers.

#### 4.1. Rust bindings for Python

We will start by writing the Rust code for our API service. We will use Rust bindings for Python to calculate the pi digits. We will use [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs) to create the Rust bindings for Python. PyO3 is a Rust binding for the Python interpreter. It provides a convenient way of extending Python with Rust. PyO3 supports all recent versions of CPython 3 as well as PyPy3.

Create file `chudnovsky.rs` in `rust-pidigits/src` directory:

```rust
use pyo3::{exceptions::PyValueError, PyResult};
use rug::{ops::Pow, Float, Integer};

// chudnovsky algorithm for calculating pi digits to the Nth digit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm). Returns a string representation of the pi digits. The number of digits is determined by the digits parameter. The digits parameter must be greater than 0 and less than (2^32-1)/4.

fn binary_split(a: u32, b: u32) -> (Integer, Integer, Integer) {
    if b - a == 1 {
        if a == 0 {
            let pab = Integer::from(1);
            let qab = Integer::from(1);
            let rab = Integer::from(&pab * (13591409 + 545140134 * a));
            return (pab, qab, rab);
        }
        let a_bigint = Integer::from(a);
        let pab: Integer = (Integer::from(6 * &a_bigint) - 5)
            * (Integer::from(2 * &a_bigint) - 1)
            * (Integer::from(6 * &a_bigint) - 1);
        let qab = a_bigint.clone().pow(3) * 10939058860032000u64;
        let rab = &pab * (13591409 + 545140134 * a_bigint);

        if a % 2 == 0 {
            return (pab, qab, rab);
        }
        return (pab, qab, -1 * rab);
    }
    let m = (a + b) / 2;
    let (pam, qam, ram) = binary_split(a, m);
    let (pmb, qmb, rmb) = binary_split(m, b);
    let p1n = Integer::from(&pam * &pmb);
    let q1n = Integer::from(&qam * &qmb);
    let r1n = Integer::from(&ram * &qmb) + Integer::from(&pam * &rmb);
    (p1n, q1n, r1n)
}

pub fn chudnovsky(digits: u32) -> PyResult<String> {
    match digits {
        0 => return Ok("3".to_string()),
        1 => return Ok("3.1".to_string()),
        _ => {
            if digits.checked_mul(4).is_none() {
                return Err(PyValueError::new_err(
                    "Invalid digits: value must be between 0 <= x < (2^32-1)/4",
                ));
            }
        }
    }
    let used_precision = digits * 4;
    let digits_per_term = f32::log10(10939058860032000f32 / 6f32 / 2f32 / 6f32);
    let n = (digits as f32 / digits_per_term).ceil() as u32;
    let i1 = Integer::from(426880);
    let i2 = Float::with_val(used_precision, 10005);

    let (_, q1n, r1n) = binary_split(0, n);
    Ok(((i1 * i2.sqrt() * q1n) / r1n).to_string())
}
```

Next place the following code in `lib.rs` file in `rust-pidigits/src` directory:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

pub mod chudnovsky;
use chudnovsky::chudnovsky;

#[pyfunction]
fn chudnovsky_pi(py: Python, digits: u32) -> PyResult<String> {
    py.allow_threads(move || chudnovsky(digits))
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust.
#[pymodule]
fn rust_pidigits(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(chudnovsky_pi, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The `#[pyfunction]` attribute is used to mark a function as a Python function. The `#[pymodule]` attribute is used to mark a module as a Python module. You can read more about PyO3's attributes, [pyfunction](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/prelude/attr.pyfunction.html) and [pymodule](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/prelude/attr.pymodule.html).

The `allow_threads` temporarily releases the GIL, thus allowing other Python threads to run. If you don’t need to touch the Python interpreter for some time and have other Python threads around, this will let you run Rust-only code while letting those other Python threads make progress ([allow_threads in api doc](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/marker/struct.Python.html#method.allow_threads)).

The `PyResult` type is a wrapper around `Result` that is used to return errors from Python functions. You can read more about PyO3's error handling [here](https://pyo3.rs/v0.20.2/function/error_handling).

Now we are ready to build our Rust extension. We will use `maturin` to build our Rust extension. Running `maturin build` will produce a wheel file in the `rust-pidigits/target/wheels` directory. The wheel file will be named `pidigits-0.1.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl` (your version may differ). The wheel file contains the compiled Rust code and the Python bindings. The wheel file can be installed with pip. More info about wheel files can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#binary-distribution-format).

```bash
poetry run maturin build
```

If you want to build a wheel file for a specific Python version, you can use the `--interpreter` option:

```bash
poetry run maturin build --interpreter python3.12
```

If everything went well, maturin was able to build the wheel file and you should see the produced wheel file in the `rust-pidigits/target/wheels` directory.

Now we are ready to start writing some Python code! 🎉 Nice work! 👍  

### 4.2. Python API service

First create a `main.py` file in the `src` directory and add the following code to it:

```python
import math
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Query
from pydantic import BaseModel
from rust_pidigits import chudnovsky_pi

app = FastAPI()


MAX_DIGITS = math.ceil((2**32 - 1) / 4)


@app.get("/pidigits/")
async def pidigits(
    digits: Annotated[int, Query(ge=0, lt=MAX_DIGITS)],
    limit: Annotated[int | None, Query(gt=0, lt=MAX_DIGITS)] = None,
) -> str:
    try:
        if limit is not None:
            return chudnovsky_pi(digits)[: limit + 2]
        return chudnovsky_pi(digits)[: digits + 2]
    except (ValueError, OverflowError) as ex:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail=str(ex),
        )


class HealthResponse(BaseModel):
    status: str


@app.get("/healthz")
async def healthz() -> HealthResponse:
    return HealthResponse(status="ok")
```

Here we are using FastAPI to create a simple API service. We have two endpoints: `/pidigits/` and `/healthz`. The `/pidigits/` endpoint takes two query parameters: `digits` and `limit`. The `digits` parameter is used to determine the number of pi digits to return. The `limit` parameter is used to limit the number of pi digits to return. The `/healthz` endpoint is used to check the health of the API service. The `/healthz` endpoint returns a simple JSON object with the status `ok`. You can read more about FastAPI's query parameters [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/). You can read more about FastAPI's endpoints [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params/). Because this is a very simple API, we have defined endpoints in the same file as the main function. In a real-world application, you would probably define the endpoints in a separate file.

Our rust extension can be imported with `from pidigits_rust import chudnovsky_pi`. `pidigits-rust` being the name of the Rust extension and `chudnovsky_pi` being the name of the function we want to import. You can read more about PyO3's module structure [here](https://pyo3.rs/latest/module.html).

Before we can run our API service, we need to install our Rust extension. We can install the wheel file directly with pip:

```bash
pip install rust-pidigits/target/wheels/pidigits-0.1.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl
```

or we can install the wheel file with Poetry:

```bash
poetry run pip install rust-pidigits/target/wheels/pidigits-0.1.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl
```

Now we are ready to run our API service! 🎉

### 4.3. Run the API service

We will use uvicorn to run our API service. Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools. You can read more about uvicorn [here](https://www.uvicorn.org/). Running the following command from the project root will start the API service:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.pi_api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This will start the API service on port 8000. You can now open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/healthz` to check the health of the API service. You can also go to `http://localhost:8000/pidigits/?digits=100` to get the first 100 digits of pi. If you like limit the number of digits to 10, you can go to `http://localhost:8000/pidigits/?digits=100&limit=10`.

You can also use curl to test the API service:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/pidigits/?digits=100
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/pidigits/?digits=100&limit=10
```

If the API service is running, you should get the following responses:

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

```json
"3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679"
```

```json
"3.1415926535"
```

Great! Now we are ready to package our API service in a Docker container! 🎉 Great work! 👍

### 5. Containerization

As a final step, we will package our API service in a Docker container. We will use a multi-stage build to keep the size of the final image as small as possible. The base image for the final image will be `python:3.12-bookworm`. We will also create a docker-compose.yml file to run our API service and a few other services in Docker containers.

### 5.1 .dockerignore

Since Docker copies all files from the building folder, we will to add the `.dockerignore` file to the project root that contains the patterns of paths to avoid copying these files. It's useful, for example, to skip the target building folder, because it may contain large files that are not needed in the final image.

```dockerignore
**/target/
**/Cargo.lock

.dockerignore
.git
.gitignore
.vscode
**/__pycache__
```

You can read more about Docker's .dockerignore file [here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/context/#dockerignore-files).

### 5.2. Dockerfile

Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the root of the project and add the following code to it:

```dockerfile
# pull official base image
FROM python:3.11-bookworm as base

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# install system dependencies
RUN set -eux; \
    apt update; \
    apt -y upgrade; \
    apt install --no-install-recommends wget -y; \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip; \
    apt autoremove -y; \
    apt clean; \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*;


FROM base AS python-deps

ENV PATH="${PATH}:/root/.local/bin"
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"

# Install poetry
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-c"]
RUN set -eux; \
    apt-get update; \
    apt-get install --no-install-recommends curl gcc libc6-dev clang lld -y; \
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -; \
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y; \
    poetry self update


# Install python dependencies in /.venv
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
COPY ./pidigits-rust ./pidigits-rust
RUN POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=1 poetry install
RUN poetry run maturin build -m pidigits-rust/Cargo.toml; \
    poetry add pidigits-rust/target/wheels/*.whl; \
    poetry install


FROM base AS runtime

# set work directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy virtual env from python-deps stage
COPY --from=python-deps /.venv /.venv
ENV PATH="/.venv/bin:$PATH"

# create the app user
RUN adduser --group --system appuser; \
    chown appuser:appuser /app

# copy project
COPY src start.bash ./

# run entrypoint
USER appuser
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT ["bash", "start.bash"]
```

We need one last thing before we can build our Docker image. We need to create a `start.bash` file in the root of the project and add the following code to it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
uvicorn pidigits.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 
```

This file will be used as the entrypoint for our Docker image. The entrypoint is the command that is executed when the container is started. You can read more about Docker's entrypoint [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint).

### 5.3. docker-compose.yml

Even though we can run our API service with Docker, it's not very convenient. We have to build the Docker image and then run the Docker container. We can make this process a lot easier by using docker-compose. We will create a docker-compose.yml file to run our API service. 
Create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` in the root of the project and add the following code to it:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    expose:
      - 8000
    healthcheck:
      test: curl --fail backend:8000/healthz || exit 1
      interval: 30s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 20s
      timeout: 5s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Now we are ready to run our API service with docker-compose! 🎉

### 5.4. Run the API service with docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the API service on port 8000. You can now verify that the API service is working correctly.

This is the final step! 🎉 Great work! 👍

## Appendix C: Python extensions

Using Rust extension in Python is not the only way to speed up Python code or if you need to integrate with C/C++ code. In this section we will look at some of them. We will also look at some of the tools that can be used.

### Cython

[Cython](https://cython.org/) is a superset of the programming language Python, which allows developers to write Python code (with optional, C-inspired syntax extensions) that yields performance comparable to that of C.

### Numba

[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.

### PyPy

[PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) is a drop-in replacement for the stock Python interpreter, CPython. Whereas CPython compiles Python to intermediate bytecode that is then interpreted by a virtual machine, PyPy uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to translate Python code into machine-native assembly language.

### ctypes

[ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes) is a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries. It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python.

### cffi

[C Foreign Function Interface for Python](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Interact with almost any C code from Python, based on C-like declarations that you can often copy-paste from header files or documentation.

## Appendix D: mdbook

This workshop is also available as a [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). If you want to build the mdbook, you need to install mdbook. You can install mdbook with the following command:

```bash
cargo install mdbook
```

Also you need to install [mdbook-admonish](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish)

After you have installed mdbook, you can build the mdbook with the following command:

```bash
mdbook build
```

This will build the mdbook in the `book` directory. You can now open the `book/index.html` file in your browser to view the mdbook. You can also serve the mdbook with the following command (this will serve the mdbook on port 3000):

```bash
mdbook serve . -p 3000
```
